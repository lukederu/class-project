      <p>
        Everyday, I ride my bike to Weber State. It takes me approximately 14
        minutes. If I had that Harley Davidson, it would take me 67 seconds.
        Over the course of 4 years, driving every day, that would save me
        1,128,580 seconds. Do you know how much homework I could do in that
        time? A lot...
